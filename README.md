# Learn Vue 3: Step by Step

This repository was used to follow the course provided by Laracasts:

[Vue 3: Step by Step](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-3-step-by-step)

My goal is to get a refresher on modern JavaScript, kind of as a prerequisite for VueJS.

This repo will also include:
- Assignments (if the course provides it)
- Files created while working with each lesson.
- Wiki, which includes notes/reviews of what I've learned.

## How to Run
With Node installed, run `npx serve`.
